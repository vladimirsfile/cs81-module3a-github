# cs81-module3a-github
A JavaScript function repository for my CS81 Class - Module 3A


The first function simply takes the user's name, adds hello in front of it
and greet the person.

The second function takes an input of set of two numbers and 
returns back the bigger number. If both numbers happens to be
equal, the functions prints that number one and number two are
equal. 

The third function takes a list of numners and outputs back only 
the odd numbers from that list. 

The fourth function gets the first and the last name of a person
and returns back his or hers initials.

The fifth function takes the width and height of a rectangle and
then calculates and returns the area.
