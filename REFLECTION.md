1. What did you learn about using Git and GitHub?

I have some basic understanding with Git and GitHub from a Coursera course I took a few years ago. I learned that using these tools is a great way to store projects in a repository that can be accessed from anywhere. For this assignment, I set up both my Mac Mini and my MacBook to push and pull from GitHub. I also learned the workflow order of "Add", "Commit", and "Push" which is easy to remember because it follows alphabetical order.

2. What was most confusing or frustrating?

It was confusing troubleshooting the Terminal environment. For example the command "code REFLECTION.md" didn't work directly from the Terminal. So I had to update the PATH for VS Code.

3. Why do you think developers use Git?

I think that the best feature of Git, besides easy collaboration, is the ability for users to easily revert back in previous snapshot in time. If you run into a problem this is a lifesaver. 

4. How might this help with larger projects in the future?

Git is be very useful in cases with its branches. For example, if you create a branch for some update or something, but it turns out to be a mistake, you can easily return back to where the code was working properly.
